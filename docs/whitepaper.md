# Maaser (MSW Coin) – White Paper

## 1. Vision
Maaser is the world’s first digital currency whose value is built directly on **community adoption**, not speculation or insider allocations.  
Its growth is tied to **clear milestones** (user counts). This creates an economy founded on **transparency, trust, and mutual responsibility**.

## 2. Problem
Most digital offerings (ICO/IDO/IEO) suffer from:
- **Insider allocations** that concentrate control.
- **Early speculation** without real adoption.
- A **disconnect** between token price and actual utility.

## 3. Solution — Maaser Structured Offering (MSO)
- **100% community distribution** (no team/foundation/advisors).
- **Value increases only** as the community grows.
- **Internal utility first:** transfers/payments only **inside** the app until major milestones.
- **External trading delayed:** no DEX/CEX until **1,000,000 users**.

## 4. Coin Economy (MSW)
- **Total Supply:** 10,000,000,000 MSW *(symbolic; adjustable)*  
- **Distribution:** 100% to community participants via the MSO process.  
- **Reference Price:** a non-binding price marker that advances **only at milestones** (see below).

## 5. Milestone Ladder

| Milestone | Reference Price | Utility |
|---|---:|---|
| **The First 1,000 Global Founders** | $0.10 | Internal transfers; founders recognized as symbolic co-creators. |
| **10,000 Users** | $0.20 | Wider internal use: payments, pooling, shared wallet functions. |
| **100,000 Users** | $1.00 | Expanded services; community governance features; pilot scaling. |
| **1,000,000 Users** | $10.00 | External trading enabled (DEX/CEX); Governance DAO established. |

### Notes
- **Reference price** is a **progression anchor** for internal economy and reporting; it is not a market guarantee.  
- **No secondary markets** until the 1M milestone to prevent early speculation and align value with adoption.

## 6. Utility & Platform
- **Transfers & Payments:** P2P inside the Maaser app.
- **Pooling / Shared Wallet:** group funds for community aims (relief, education, innovation).
- **Ecosystem Services:** staged integrations (merchant/payroll pilots) as milestones are met.

## 7. Governance Path
- Pre-DAO: open development, public repos, community proposals.
- At/after **1,000,000 users**: move to a **Governance DAO** (see `docs/governance.md`) for treasury, upgrades, and policy.

## 8. Compliance & Transparency
- Open repositories, auditable smart contracts (when applicable).
- Clear contributor guidelines and disclosures.
- Jurisdictional compliance to be defined per rollout phase.

## 9. Roadmap (High-Level)
1. **Global Founders (1–1,000):** identity verification, founder badges, internal transfers live.  
2. **Early Expansion (1,001–10,000):** payments, pooling, shared wallet features.  
3. **Scale-Up (10,001–100,000):** services expansion, governance preview.  
4. **Pre-Listing (100,001–1,000,000):** audits, final governance design, exchange readiness.  
5. **Listing + DAO (≥1,000,000):** enable DEX/CEX and launch Governance DAO.
