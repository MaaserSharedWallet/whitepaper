# Tokenomics â€“ Maaser (MSW)

## Supply & Distribution
- **Total Supply:** 10,000,000,000 MSW *(symbolic; adjustable prior to contract deployment)*
- **Allocation:** **100% community** via Maaser Structured Offering (MSO)
- **No** team/foundation/advisor allocations. Governance funding is community-approved later via DAO.

## Price Progression
- **Reference Price** advances **only** when user milestones are reached.
- No external market price until **1,000,000 users** and DAO ratification.

| Milestone | Reference Price |
|---|---:|
| 1,000 (Global Founders) | $0.10 |
| 10,000 | $0.20 |
| 100,000 | $1.00 |
| 1,000,000 | $10.00 |

> *Reference Price is an internal accounting anchor for MSO phases; it does not represent a promise of market value.*

## Utility
- Internal **P2P transfers** and **payments** in app.
- **Pooling / Shared Wallet** functions (community goals).
- Merchant and payroll pilots introduced as milestones are met.

## Anti-Speculation Guardrails
- **No listing** (DEX/CEX) before **1M users**.
- **Transparent issuance**; public ledger of allocations.
- **Immutable milestone rules** defined in governance pre-launch.

## Treasury / Operations
- No pre-minted treasury. Any future treasury is created **by DAO vote** and must be transparently tracked.

## Disclaimers
- Tokenomics may be iterated by community proposal prior to mainnet deployment.
- Regulatory compliance will be addressed per jurisdiction and may affect rollout/availability.
