# Governance Path – Maaser

## Pre-DAO (Milestones < 1,000,000)
- Open development in public repos.
- Community discussion via issues/PRs.
- Signaling votes (off-chain) on major parameters.

## DAO Formation (≥ 1,000,000 Users)
- Establish a **Governance DAO** with:
  - **Proposal process:** community can submit MIPs (Maaser Improvement Proposals).
  - **Voting:** token-weighted or hybrid (to be decided by community during Pre-DAO).
  - **Treasury:** created only by DAO vote; transparent, on-chain.
  - **Milestone enforcement:** DAO custodies rules; listings only after the 1M milestone.

## Principles
- **Transparency first** (public code, public budget).
- **No insider control** (no permanent privileged roles).
- **Reversibility with consensus** (upgrades via MIPs).
