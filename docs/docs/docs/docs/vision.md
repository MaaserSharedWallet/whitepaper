# Vision (Executive Summary)

The modern economy concentrates wealth at the top of the pyramid. **Maaser** proposes a practical correction: keep **90% capitalism** fully intact while routing **10% into a shared wallet** that circulates through communities, rebuilding **trust, flow, and mutual responsibility**.

Maaser’s token (MSW) advances in **user-count milestones**, not speculation.  
The **First 1,000 Global Founders** are recognized as symbolic co-creators.  
External trading is only enabled when the community reaches **1,000,000 users**—aligning value with real adoption.
