## 🔍 What is Maaser?
Maaser is a structured offering model where the **reference price advances only at user-count milestones**.  
- **100% distribution to the community** (no team/foundation/advisor allocations).  
- **Internal utility first** (transfers/payments inside the app).  
- **No external listing** (DEX/CEX) until **1,000,000 users**.

## 🪜 Milestone Ladder

| Milestone | Reference Price | Utility |
|---|---:|---|
| **The First 1,000 Global Founders** | $0.10 | Internal transfers; founders recognized as symbolic co-creators. |
| **10,000 Users** | $0.20 | Wider internal use: payments, pooling, shared-wallet functions. |
| **100,000 Users** | $1.00 | Expanded services; community governance features; pilot scaling. |
| **1,000,000 Users** | $10.00 | External trading enabled (DEX/CEX); establish Governance DAO. |

*“Reference price” is an internal progression anchor, not a market guarantee.*
